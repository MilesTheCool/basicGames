# OVERVIEW

A arcade-like game package to choose between many games. 
Some games are single player, some are 1v1, and some are 2-4 players competitive
There should be a main menu with all games on it to choose between.
Mid game there should be a pause button to reset, close application, or go back to main menu

There should be a settings menu as well for screen size and volume.
(even at fullscreen it will likely be windowed)
